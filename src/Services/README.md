## Services

This is handy if you're making a plain JavaScript module that the rest of the application will use. 
You can add a file like localStorage or other services that can be needed.

Below is a tree example of how this folder might look

/services
        ├── /LocalStorage
        │   ├── LocalStorage.service.js
        │   └── LocalStorage.test.js
        └── index.js
