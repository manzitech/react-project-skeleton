## Utils

Depending on the requirement of your project you might need this folder or not. But utils is an important folder because you can add some important functions like validation and conversion, that could easily be used across multiple sections of the app.

An example of the possible Utils folder structure

/utils
        ├── /constants
        │   └── countries.constants.js
        └── /helpers
            ├── validation.helpers.js
            ├── currency.helpers.js
            └── array.helpers.js
