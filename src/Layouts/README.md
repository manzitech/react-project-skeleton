## Layout

A clean react project usually has different layouts. Please add you layouts here. It can be mainLayout, auth layout or others dependning on the requirements  of your project. Layouts are in charge of of generating the main structure so that the routes it defines use it in order to paint its content. For example you can have different navigation links for a logged in user and a non logged in user.
